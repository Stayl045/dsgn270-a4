## dsgn-270-a4: Stephan's Harry Rosen E-commerce Mockups

#### Inspiration for my Design and my Thoughts

### Attribution

- My brother Adrian Taylor
  - He showed me this [website](https://www.awwwards.com/) to help inspire me for the design of my mockup
    - On this link I found this [website](https://www.sneakinpeace.com/). This site didn't seem nearly as complex as other websites on the `awwwards` site, but still had a very clean layout that I really liked.
