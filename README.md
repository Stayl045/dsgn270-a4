## dsgn-270-a4: Stephan's Harry Rosen E-commerce Mockups

#### Inspiration for my Design and my Thoughts

- I spent a few hours on March 14th contemplating a website theme and layout. I didn't want to tread old territory and re-use old ideas. Hence, asking my brother for help.
  - He pointed to a website the showcased many cool and insping website designs. All of which I hope to emulate in the near future.
- They layout I choose seemed simple, but elegant. This is why I choose it. And the theme of this mockup is e-commerce products of Harry Rosen.
- I also found all images i used on [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- The most difficult aspect I found of this assignment is to get all the cards and hero to match the dimensions of the frame perfectly. This took a bunch of fine tuning, but I think I got it in the end.
- The website is very monochromatic with, therefore there wasn't much in the way of a style sheet besides the color that I used in the navigation bar. Other then that, it was very white and black..
- would also like to point out that I do 5 sections of content, its just very apparent due to the design. The navigation menu is in one of the heros, there is the second hero to the right with a cta, the 5 cards below and lastly the footer.
- I do have libraries of the font styling that I am using and color (1 color) that I used

  - He showed me this [website](https://www.awwwards.com/) to help inspire me for the design of my mockup
    - On this link I found this [website](https://www.sneakinpeace.com/). This site didn't seem nearly as complex as other websites on the `awwwards` site, but still had a very clean layout that I really liked.
